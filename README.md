# Tudor is Self-Recording studio for multiple tutors.
### Why Tudor?
This service is made to help tutors record themselves. Tutors. So...it's just like a typo in Tutor which brings sense of humour and sound of medieval.

Naming:
   - /host = host is application API which handles direct operations to FFMPEG. Private.
   - /site_app = Public service part which runs inside docker container and have access to database and port on host
   - /site_app/`welsh` = Welsh is backend project for django
   - /site_app/welsh/`ludlow` = Ludlow is django app, it handles all public API
   - /site_app/`york` = York is React app,
